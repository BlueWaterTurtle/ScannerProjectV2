# ScannerProjectV2 - Current Program Status

## Overview
ScannerProjectV2 is a **Java-based file monitoring and barcode processing application** that watches directories for PDF files, extracts barcodes from them, and renames/moves files based on the detected barcode content.

## Current State: **FUNCTIONAL ✅**

### What's Working
- ✅ **Builds successfully** with Maven
- ✅ **Compiles without errors** (fixed compilation issues)
- ✅ **Runs and monitors directories** for new PDF files
- ✅ **Barcode extraction** from PDF files using ZXing and PDFBox
- ✅ **File stability checking** (waits for files to finish writing)
- ✅ **Collision handling** (adds counter suffixes for duplicate names)
- ✅ **Proper Maven project structure** (src/main/java)

### Architecture
```
RenameWatcher (Main Application)
├── Watches 'incoming' directory using Java NIO WatchService
├── Detects new PDF files
├── Calls BarcodeUtils for barcode extraction
└── Moves/renames files to 'finished' directory

BarcodeUtils (Barcode Processing)
├── PDF-to-image rendering (PDFBox)
├── Multi-format barcode reading (ZXing)
├── Image rotation for better detection
└── Support for QR codes, Code128, EAN13, PDF417
```

### Technical Details
- **Language**: Java 17
- **Build Tool**: Maven 3.9+
- **Dependencies**: 
  - ZXing 3.5.2 (barcode reading)
  - PDFBox 2.0.31 (PDF processing)
- **Code Size**: ~419 lines of Java code
- **Main Class**: `RenameWatcher`

### Key Features Implemented
1. **File Watching**: Monitors directories for new files using Java NIO WatchService
2. **PDF Processing**: Renders PDF pages to images for barcode scanning
3. **Multi-format Barcode Reading**: Supports QR codes, Code128, EAN13, PDF417
4. **Rotation Support**: Tries multiple orientations if initial scan fails
5. **File Stability**: Waits for files to stop changing before processing
6. **Retry Logic**: Multiple attempts if barcode detection initially fails
7. **Collision Handling**: Automatic counter suffixes for duplicate filenames
8. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unreadable files or failed scans

### How to Run
```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean package

# Run the application
java -cp "target/classes:$(mvn -q dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=/dev/stdout)" RenameWatcher
```

### Directory Structure
```
incoming/     # Drop PDF files here
finished/     # Renamed files end up here
```

### Example Workflow
1. Drop a PDF file into `incoming/` directory
2. Application detects the new file
3. Waits for file to stabilize (finish writing)
4. Renders PDF pages to images
5. Scans images for barcodes (with rotation attempts)
6. Renames file to `{barcode}.pdf`
7. Moves file to `finished/` directory
8. Handles collisions by adding counter suffixes

## Issues Fixed ✅
- ❌ **Malformed Maven POM** → ✅ Fixed with proper XML structure
- ❌ **Compilation errors** → ✅ Fixed method signatures and imports
- ❌ **File structure** → ✅ Organized into proper Maven structure

## Current Status vs. Planned Features
From the readme.txt roadmap:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Directory watch (Java NIO WatchService) | **✅ IMPLEMENTED** | Working and tested |
| Barcode validation & normalization | **✅ IMPLEMENTED** | Basic sanitization in place |
| Collision handling (duplicate target names) | **✅ IMPLEMENTED** | Counter suffix strategy |
| File rename strategy abstraction | ⚠️ BASIC | Could be improved with Strategy pattern |
| Configurable patterns | ❌ PLANNED | Currently hardcoded |
| Dry run mode | ❌ PLANNED | Not implemented |
| Logging via SLF4J | ❌ PLANNED | Currently uses System.out |
| Unit & integration tests | ❌ PLANNED | No tests yet |

## Assessment: **GOOD FOUNDATION, READY FOR ENHANCEMENT**

### Strengths
- **Solid core functionality** - the main use case works
- **Well-structured code** with clear separation of concerns
- **Robust error handling** for file operations
- **Production-ready features** like stability checking and retry logic
- **Modern Java practices** (Java 17, proper Maven structure)

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Configuration system** - currently hardcoded paths and settings
2. **Logging framework** - replace System.out with proper logging
3. **Testing** - no unit or integration tests
4. **Documentation** - could use JavaDoc and usage examples
5. **CLI interface** - no command-line argument parsing
6. **Metrics/monitoring** - no observability features

### Recommendation
The program is in a **good working state** and demonstrates solid Java development practices. It successfully fulfills its core purpose of PDF barcode scanning and file organization. The next logical steps would be adding configuration management, proper logging, and comprehensive testing.
